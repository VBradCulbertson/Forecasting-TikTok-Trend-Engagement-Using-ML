# Forecasting-TikTok-Trend-Engagement-Using-ML
TikTok trends are relatively short-lived. Marketing campaigns average weeks to months from conceptualization to production and release. A more agile approach to marketing campaigns may allow companies and creators to leverage trending songs/sounds on the TikTok platform to maximize engagement.

What would it take to forecast Engagement without using "crystal ball features". Modeling is incredibly accuracte if we feed our models the Views, Shares, Likes, and Comments a video receives; these aren't known ahead of video creation and upload. If those features are excluded from analysis, how well will models perform? When is the optimum window to post video content during a trend to maximize engagement?
